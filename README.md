# Optimal Control Tests

This repository contains minimal experiments for robot control and simulation.

This repository is part of a larger ongoing effort and will be updated gradually as development progresses.

## Contents
- `src/` – Source code (ROS 2 nodes, MuJoCo simulation, control experiments)
- Initial experiments with robot joint-level interfaces
- Minimal ROS 2 publisher/subscriber examples

## Upcoming
Planned additions include:
- Robot simulations using MuJoCo
- Different types of controllers (position, velocity, torque, and optimal control)
- Joint state feedback and joint command interfaces
- ROS 2 integration for simulation–controller communication
- Experiments with joint positions, velocities, and control laws

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2 (Humble or later)
- Python 3.10+
- MuJoCo

## Usage
This repository is intended for learning and experimentation with:
- Robot simulation
- Control system development
- ROS 2 interfaces for robot control

## Notes
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `install/`, `log/`) are intentionally ignored.
- This is a work-in-progress learning and research repository.
